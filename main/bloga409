From Thanksgiving to New Years, our office loves to jump into holiday cheer. Here are a few of our own holiday traditions that we’d love to share. Perhaps you might find something to fold into your own festive activities.</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><p class=""><strong>Hyleh</strong> - Despite all of us being adults, we have a running bit in my family that Santa is still coming to our house. To prepare for Santa, we spend Christmas Eve decorating cookies to leave with a glass of milk and some carrots for the reindeer. After the cookies are decorated, we end the night by gathering around the dining table to play a series of games.</p><p class="">This is a tradition that no one wants to outgrow and something I want to carry on for my own children, nieces, and nephews.</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><p class=""><strong>Madison</strong> - Hidden pickle ornament - There are several variations to this tradition and what it means, but here is how I experienced the hidden pickle. Growing up, my parents would hide the pickle ornament somewhere on the tree. On Christmas Eve, my sister and I had to search for the pickle ornament and whoever found it got to open 1 present early. It was a fun tradition that I have carried on with my own children.&nbsp;</p><p class=""><br><strong>Jake</strong> - Christmas Eve luminaries and fresh PJs. A childhood holiday tradition was opening a select group of presents on Christmas Eve. One of the most essential gifts was always a brand new pair of pajamas to sleep into to usher in Christmas morning. On the way back home after visiting family, we’d drive a stretch of county road lined with hundreds of luminaries, which are candles placed in paper bags</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><p class=""><strong>Claire</strong> - Christmas Cookie Baking - Every year I dedicate a few days to making elaborate Christmas cookie trays for my friends and family. These trays usually include: chocolate chip cookies, lemon coolers, ginger bread, Oreo cheesecake balls, buckeyes, kiss cookies, chocolate peppermint pinwheels, and cherry almond balls. It is so much work but putting on a classic Christmas movie like Elf, and spending the day baking is something I look forward to all year. And they are always welcomed by the family.&nbsp;</p><p class=""><br><strong>Joel</strong> - We usually eat the standard way to early traditional Christmas dinner at about 1pm. I also happen to share a birthday with the Big Man, and with little kids we don't spend much of the day celebrating it. One year, I was pretty hangry late in the day so I checked Uber Eats and the only thing open were the local Chinese restaurants. Thus a tradition was born. Now, we close out Christmas and celebrate my birthday from the hours of 7 p.m. - 10 p.m. with a large selection of the best MSG laden offerings from the Golden Phoenix and a DQ ice cream cake.</p><p class=""><br></p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/62e18553aef02f736a44f06a/1671812444146-GS8DY9DCXI2VT02NIOP9/holiday+traditions+2022+Blog.jpg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="844"><media:title type="plain">Subset Holiday Traditions</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>TrendSet 2022: A Year in Digital Ad Trends</title><category>TrendSet</category><dc:creator>Jake Grilley</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 14 Dec 2022 18:17:30 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.subsetmedia.com/blog/2022trends</link><guid isPermaLink="false">62e18553aef02f736a44f06a:6390dc1a23b3c42eccd408eb:639a133a6d298442d7702880</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class="">Trends can sometimes be misunderstood.

And clients are preferring to work with agencies that have not only opened doors between departments but those that have demolished the walls altogether.In a recent study, more than two-thirds of CMOs say that siloed media and creative is no longer relevant to modern marketers. More than 80 percent of respondents say that by blending the two agencies are able to better navigate the advertising ecosystem, enhance capabilities, and offer more robust solutions.Bringing media and creative back together allows for greater integration between the two. When creative and media teams are integrated, a true collaborative and integrated service is possibleDespite some perceptions that this reintegration is a newly emerging trend in digital advertising, Subset was founded on this principle nearly half a decade ago. When it comes to creating messaging, auditing and optimizing media deployments, Subset has the team and resources to make it happen.</p><p class="">By working together, media and creative can optimize campaign performance and effectiveness</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/62e18553aef02f736a44f06a/1671204477886-E9XYGTQKFLKNN3D1XC31/brecking+ball+Blog.jpg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="844"><media:title type="plain">Clients preferring agencies that have taken a wrecking ball to siloed departments</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Clutter-Free Gift Ideas for the Holidays</title><category>Uncategorized</category><category>Weekend Series</category><dc:creator></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 02 Dec 2022 22:33:43 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.subsetmedia.com/blog/clutter-free-gifts</link><guid isPermaLink="false">62e18553aef02f736a44f06a:6390dc1a23b3c42eccd408eb:6390dc4323b3c42eccd413cb</guid><description><![CDATA[<figure class="

<p><span>The holiday season is known for giving, but with all the gift-giving people inevitably end up with at times way too much stuff.</span><span>So for anybody seeking to skip the excess stuff. Here are a few ideas for some clutter- free gifts.  These nonmaterial presents will assure that this gift won’t inevitably find its way to a garage or attic someday.</span><span></span>&nbsp;<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/62e18553aef02f736a44f06a/6390dc1a23b3c42eccd408eb/6390dc4623b3c42eccd414bd/1670437958335/AdobeStock_143825253-300x200.jpeg?format=original" alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-1707" /><span><strong>Event tickets (Concert, Sports, etc.) - </strong></span><span>The experience of attending a live event can yield lasting memories. Saying they were there to see a favorite band, team, or show live is not only a memorable gift, but an experience that will last a lifetime.</span>&nbsp;<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/62e18553aef02f736a44f06a/6390dc1a23b3c42eccd408eb/6390dc4623b3c42eccd414c0/1670437958355/AdobeStock_154441096-300x200.jpeg?format=original" alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-1708" /><span><strong>Chip in on a travel expense</strong> - A getaway is a perfect gift. Either by planning a trip together or by chipping in to help fund a vacation, adding a bit extra to a travel budget can go a long way.</span>&nbsp;<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/62e18553aef02f736a44f06a/6390dc1a23b3c42eccd408eb/6390dc4623b3c42eccd414c3/1670437958378/AdobeStock_119566855-300x200.jpeg?format=original" alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-1705" /><span><strong> Streaming or music subscription</strong> - The world of entertainment is at our fingertips. With almost every film, album, and TV show available to stream somewhere, give your giftee a subscription to the service they prefer.</span>&nbsp;<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/62e18553aef02f736a44f06a/6390dc1a23b3c42eccd408eb/6390dc4623b3c42eccd414c6/1670437958397/AdobeStock_514930058-300x200.jpeg?format=original" alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-1721" /><span><strong> Gift cards</strong> - Sometimes, gifting a gift card can make you feel like you're slacking. However, a gift card from a shop, restaurant, coffee shop, or even Amazon or Apple can make a thoughtful present. It is especially true when they are carefully curated for the recipient.</span>&nbsp;<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/62e18553aef02f736a44f06a/6390dc1a23b3c42eccd408eb/6390dc4623b3c42eccd414c9/1670437958416/AdobeStock_338314566-300x200.jpeg?format=original" alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-1715" /><span><strong> Lesson or class</strong> - Does your loved one have an interest in something, but has just never had the time or money to learn more about it? Then why not force them into it with an online or in person class. It’s never too late to learn something new.</span>&nbsp;<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/62e18553aef02f736a44f06a/6390dc1a23b3c42eccd408eb/6390dc4623b3c42eccd414cc/1670437958435/AdobeStock_451400003-300x209.jpeg?format=original" alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-1718" /><span><strong>Activity pass</strong> - Shows, waterparks, golf, skiing; no matter the activity, gifting somebody the opportunity to participate in their favorite pursuit guarantees a good time. </span>&nbsp;<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/62e18553aef02f736a44f06a/6390dc1a23b3c42eccd408eb/6390dc4623b3c42eccd414cf/1670437958455/AdobeStock_290124711-300x200.jpeg?format=original" alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-1712" /><span><strong>Self-care certificate</strong> - Plan a spa day. Whether you book a massage, spa package, float session, facial, aromatherapy, manicure, pedicure, pamper your recipient by scheduling some self-care. </span>&nbsp;<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/62e18553aef02f736a44f06a/6390dc1a23b3c42eccd408eb/6390dc4623b3c42eccd414d2/1670437958474/AdobeStock_193398848-300x161.jpeg?format=original" alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-1709" /><span><strong> Charity donation</strong> - Giving money to an organization that is near and dear to your giftee’s heart can really show you care. Each year, I make a donation on behalf of all my friends to the Human Fund. </span>&nbsp;<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/62e18553aef02f736a44f06a/6390dc1a23b3c42eccd408eb/6390dc4623b3c42eccd414d5/1670437958493/AdobeStock_336857903-300x200.jpeg?format=original" alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-1714" /><span><strong> Meal delivery service</strong> - We’ve all gotten the “I don't know, you decide” when it comes to choosing what’s for dinner. Perhaps the greatest weeknight gift of all is letting a service decide for you. Hellofresh, Blue Apron, etc</span>&nbsp;<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/62e18553aef02f736a44f06a/6390dc1a23b3c42eccd408eb/6390dc4623b3c42eccd414d8/1670437958511/AdobeStock_501970001-300x200.jpeg?format=original" alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-1720" /><strong>Wellness subscription</strong> - Everybody will enjoy the gift of stress relief through a meditation app or on-demand workout platform.&nbsp;<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/62e18553aef02f736a44f06a/6390dc1a23b3c42eccd408eb/6390dc4623b3c42eccd414db/1670437958529/AdobeStock_104070721-300x200.jpeg?format=original" alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-1704" /><span><strong>Car service</strong> - Oil changes, small repairs, or car upgrades, are things that just have to be done, and we hate spending our own hard earned dollars on them. It’s such a wonderful surprise when a loved one hooks you up, so you don't have to.</span>&nbsp;<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/62e18553aef02f736a44f06a/6390dc1a23b3c42eccd408eb/6390dc2223b3c42eccd40f55/1670437922987/AdobeStock_413765283-scaled-e1670020123136.jpeg?format=original" alt="" class="wp-image-1717" /><strong>Gift baskets of favorite products</strong> - Skip the guessing game and the clutter and go with their favorite products. I always add my favorite makeup remover, laundry detergent, shampoo, and lotion to my Christmas list. I know I will use them and it’s a thoughtful gift to give someone something they use regularly.&nbsp;<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/62e18553aef02f736a44f06a/6390dc1a23b3c42eccd408eb/6390dc4623b3c42eccd414de/1670437958556/AdobeStock_224671539-300x200.jpeg?format=original" alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-1710" /><strong>Tattoos</strong> - people who like to get tatted would be absolutely thrilled to receive money towards their next art piece. It may seem unconventional, but giving great gifts is about knowing the person.&nbsp;<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/62e18553aef02f736a44f06a/6390dc1a23b3c42eccd408eb/6390dc4623b3c42eccd414e1/1670437958575/AdobeStock_298678837-300x200.jpeg?format=original" alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-1713" /><span><strong>Household services</strong> - Is your loved one hosting a large Christmas gathering? What better gift than a cleaning service after the holidays!</span>&nbsp;<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/62e18553aef02f736a44f06a/6390dc1a23b3c42eccd408eb/6390dc4623b3c42eccd414e4/1670437958595/AdobeStock_243853739-300x200.jpeg?format=original" alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-1711" /><span><strong>Date Night</strong> - Movie tickets, gift card + reservation at a favorite restaurant, baby sitter for the kids, etc. </span>&nbsp;<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/62e18553aef02f736a44f06a/6390dc1a23b3c42eccd408eb/6390dc4623b3c42eccd414e7/1670437958615/AdobeStock_125690516-300x200.jpeg?format=original" alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-1706" /><strong>Baked goods</strong> - Everyone likes an assortment of cookies, just steer clear of fruitcakes.<br /><br /></p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/62e18553aef02f736a44f06a/1670438045509-JQTHNVU120DXDI3EWSI1/image-asset.jpeg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="844"><media:title type="plain">Clutter-Free Gift Ideas for the Holidays</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>TrendSet: Marketers reassessing attribution measurement</title><category>TrendSet</category><dc:creator></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 30 Nov 2022 19:35:16 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.subsetmedia.com/blog/attribution</link><guid isPermaLink="false">62e18553aef02f736a44f06a:6390dc1a23b3c42eccd408eb:6390dc4223b3c42eccd413c7</guid><description><![CDATA[<figure class="

<p data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="922f5bd5-894c-4819-a637-a8ed73652144">Part of this re-evaluation comes from the fact that most media buys are behind the <span data-issueid="1b416b079c5b7de1c15f835f7fee4214" class="issue-underline underline text-gray-darkest font-body decoration-2 underline-offset-4 transition decoration-primary-main hover:bg-primary-lightest" data-testid="issue-underline">walled gardens</span> of the biggest tech players in the industry.

<p>What these attribution solutions have done, however, is siphon off meaningful media dollars that could be better spent driving performance.Some industry estimates have found that some of the largest media campaigns can end up spending a quarter of their budget on attribution measurement.

Consumers, however, are now presented with a throwback option due to the proliferation of streaming options in recent years: <span data-issueid="ee20fbf69dced633407968aeedfcee51" class="issue-underline underline text-gray-darkest font-body decoration-2 underline-offset-4 transition cursor-pointer decoration-primary-main hover:bg-primary-lightest" data-testid="issue-underline">ad-supported</span> entertainment.</p>
<p>Price breaks and commercial breaks are coming to your smart TV in order to encourage consumers to adopt additional streaming services.Earlier this month, Netflix, by far the biggest holdout in the world of ad-supported streaming introduced its <span data-issueid="b815cde2ee3675f2101e4e5a91c0ccbf" class="issue-underline underline text-gray-darkest font-body decoration-2 underline-offset-4 transition cursor-pointer decoration-primary-main hover:bg-primary-lightest" data-testid="issue-underline">ad-supported</span> tier to its lineup.Disney+ will be following suit before the end of the year, joining the likes of Hulu, HBO Max, Paramount Plus, Peacock, Discovery+, Tubi, and Pluto TV.Research shows consumers are much more likely to add a new streaming service to their existing lineup if it has an ad-supported option. Studies have also shown most consumers set their streaming threshold at 3-5 services but are enticed by exclusive titles and tend to jump between services that aren’t within their individual essential 1-2.Streaming media companies are also hoping these options help to stabilize their subscriber numbers. This is because competition within the vertical remains tight and as consumers do the math when comparing their monthly streaming subscription fees to their old cable bills.For advertisers this is a new entry point for what has been an elusive audience, cord cutters.And with Netflix and Disney both introducing their ad-supported options within weeks of one another it is a tremendous amount of ad inventory to be introduced to the market all at once.These newly available ad-supported streaming options offer more choices for consumers at lower prices -- and more inventory opportunities for marketers.<em><strong>BONUS BLOG!</strong></em>For any new adopters of Netflix's new ad-supported streaming tier, here are Subset's Five Most Bingeworthly shows on Netflix.<em><strong>1.

<p class="">The old adage, “you get what you pay for.” Is applicable across most industries, and digital advertising is no exception.</p><p class="">But in an ecosystem where the entire internet acts a consumer attention marketplace why pay more for a placement that you theoretically can get elsewhere at a bargain rate?The answer is simple: results.Here are three reasons to adopt a premium inventory approach:</p><p class=""><strong>Relevancy<br></strong>One of the biggest complaints around digital advertising is it can be “annoying.” This is due in part to bad first impressions.&nbsp; Advertisers should place a premium on introducing themselves to their audience on high-quality, contextually relevant publications. By doing this, the brand is aligned with high-perceived value of the editorial content. Which goes a long way in laying the foundation for a successful consumer journey, when impressions focus on the lowest price available it often leads to misaligned messaging, poor timing, and brand exposure can suffer as a result.</p><p class=""><strong>Sequential Messaging<br></strong>As stated above, awareness messaging benefits greatly from a strong first impression. Cultivation messaging drives consumer engagement. And intent messaging — drives direct responses from interested audiences. Audience and retargeting tactics help do drive strong results in both these midfunnel and bottom funnel objectives. And as important as the targeting tactics are the placements of the ad messaging is nearly as important. While contextual relevancy isn’t as critical as it is during the initial consumer touchpoint, both context and environment remain important in terms of driving performance. Top-tier publication placements are a priority based on high-value content category, high-reach websites, brand-safe and perceived reputation.</p><p class=""><strong>Data Driven<br></strong>Inventory quality determines the accuracy and quality of the data associated with it. By leveraging premium inventory, advertisers will subsequently get higher quality data to drive their decisions. Due to the multitude of factors influencing campaign strategy, a premium approach elevates the data associated with campaigns to enable real-time optimizations. Investing in premium inventory results in premium data that elevates the customer experience at scale and optimizes performance.</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/62e18553aef02f736a44f06a/1670438042306-JYVXVWWBL72UN6FYNFXO/image-asset.jpeg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="844"><media:title type="plain">Premium inventory equates to peak campaign performance</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Top Desserts to Make with Your Extra Hour</title><category>Blog</category><dc:creator></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 03 Nov 2022 22:24:04 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.subsetmedia.com/blog/top-desserts</link><guid isPermaLink="false">62e18553aef02f736a44f06a:6390dc1a23b3c42eccd408eb:6390dc4223b3c42eccd413b7</guid><description><![CDATA[<figure class="

<p><span>Daylight Saving Time ends this weekend. And what better way to take advantage of the extra hour than treating yourself. Embrace the added time in the weekend by whipping up one of the delicious desserts below.</span><b></b>&nbsp;<b>Chucks Picks:</b><span>Since we’re all in the advertising industry, it would be wrong not to have at least a few cocktails on this list. Here are two of my favorite boozy dessert night caps.</span><b>Brandy Alexander</b><span>This high spirit bevy can be surprisingly smooth depending on the quality of your ingredients.</span><span>As its name implies, the primary spirit is brandy, however I personally use cognac to mellow it out. Brandy and cognac are essentially the same thing, but with a big difference in aging and quality. (Cognac is to brandy, what champagne is to sparkling wine)</span><span>Ingredients:</span><span>-1 1/2oz brandy or cognac</span><span>-1oz white creme de cacao</span><span>-1 oz cream</span><span>-Fresh Nutmeg</span>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Shake all ingredients except nutmeg vigorously with one or two very large (1.5-2”) ice cubes. (large ice will get your cocktail cold with less dilution as compared to standard freezer ice cubes)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;
<ol>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Strain into a chilled cocktail glass or coupe</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;
<ol>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Garnish with just a bit of fresh grated nutmeg</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<b>Real Deal Eggnog (with an actual egg)</b><span>Ingredients:</span><span>-¾ oz 5-year  rum</span><span>-¾ oz Cognac</span><span>-½ barspoon of vanilla</span><span>¾ oz simple syrup</span><span>1 oz heavy cream</span><span>1 whole egg</span><span>Garnish cinnamon and nutmeg</span>

Check out why each format is appropriate, when to use it, and a few red flags to watch out for.</p>
<p><strong>Display</strong>
<p data-private="redact" class="mb-2.5" data-wt-guid="8df82e80-ce77-4c6e-b03f-e9bd48b956cb">Internet advertising's first channel is still one of the most effective. No matter what kind of banner you use, the goal is the same. Make sure your brand is aligned with high-quality, adjacent content on reputable publications, while leveraging contextually relevant interests and audience behavior.</p>
<p><span data-issueid="d8a010a264e7a3ec7de4ae520b398a6c" class="issue-underline underline text-gray-darkest font-body decoration-2 underline-offset-4 transition cursor-pointer decoration-primary-main hover:bg-primary-lightest" data-testid="issue-underline">Best</span> Use: Display advertising can be used for almost any purpose, but it is most useful when driving actions, since consumers are accustomed to clicking display ads to learn more or take action.
<p data-private="redact" class="mb-2.5" data-wt-guid="4e63d383-0a96-40ff-b1cd-9fcf73593283">Strategy red flags: The use of the same creative for months on end or the lack of a clear call to action. Ideally, display creative is updated every 4-6 weeks, and CTAs should be properly aligned to the campaign phases and objectives.</p>
<p><strong>Video</strong>Video allow advertisers to the most of the play button. Immerse your audience in your brand's story. Video is one of the most effective ways to engage, inspire, and motivate a captivated audience.<span data-issueid="5ac57cabe62d62629e2391788b596a1a" class="issue-underline underline text-gray-darkest font-body decoration-2 underline-offset-4 transition cursor-pointer decoration-primary-main hover:bg-primary-lightest" data-testid="issue-underline">Best</span> Use: Video works well for awareness campaigns that measure reach and completion. As well as communicating brand differentiators and explaining a nuanced product, video works wonders for brands and products.
<p data-private="redact" class="mb-2.5" data-wt-guid="bd57411d-4776-43cd-bb1d-d6b61d2a50f4">Strategy red flags: Comparing programmatic video performance to social video performance is a big red flag. Programmatic video and connected TV are consumed before or between other content, and aren't always displayed with companion banners. While these videos are effective at raising awareness, consumers are not always inclined to leave their content to click through to a website, making them ineffective for converting.</p>
<p><strong>Audio</strong>
<p data-private="redact" class="mb-2.5" data-wt-guid="7f674fdd-9a80-4f44-acad-56a3e9067f28">Unlock the power of streaming music, podcasts, and more. Audiences are listening, so make sure your message is heard. Boost brand awareness and engage your audience with personal and tailored audio messages.</p>
<p><span data-issueid="3de768ab65efba0184a24fec1b74d577" class="issue-underline underline text-gray-darkest font-body decoration-2 underline-offset-4 transition cursor-pointer decoration-primary-main hover:bg-primary-lightest" data-testid="issue-underline">Best</span> Use: Awareness campaigns with KPIs based on reach and completion.
<p data-private="redact" class="mb-2.5" data-wt-guid="1ce12c35-1138-4c14-bbd6-9a8f9ead8678">Strategy Red Flags: Audio should not be used as the primary ad format to drive conversions. Advertisers should always complement audio placements with display ads in order to maximize efficiency and scale, even though campaign-specific promo codes and landing pages have made considerable progress.</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/62e18553aef02f736a44f06a/1670438041930-SW779UZL1IE4OA1FHEUQ/image-asset.jpeg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="844"><media:title type="plain">Popular media channels: best uses and red flags</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Underrated Halloween Candy</title><category>Blog</category><dc:creator></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 27 Oct 2022 20:29:14 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.subsetmedia.com/blog/underrated-halloween-candy</link><guid isPermaLink="false">62e18553aef02f736a44f06a:6390dc1a23b3c42eccd408eb:6390dc4123b3c42eccd41397</guid><description><![CDATA[<figure class="

<p>Halloween night, the costumes, the trick or treating. It is a passage of youth.The next day is when the bounty is assessed and examined. And outside of the mainstream sweets, there are hidden gems to be unearthed.Here is a list of some of the criminally underrated Halloween candies, add these to your arsenal and your trick or treaters will thank you later.&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/62e18553aef02f736a44f06a/6390dc1a23b3c42eccd408eb/6390dc1f23b3c42eccd40eaf/1670437919653/100-Grand-Wrapper-Small.jpg?format=original" alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1646" /><b>100 Grand</b><span>Maybe a name change is in order, thanks to inflation. We’re betting that if this was renamed the Million Dollar Bar more people would gravitate toward its timeless taste that combines silky smooth caramel and crispy rice coated in milk chocolate.</span>&nbsp;<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/62e18553aef02f736a44f06a/6390dc1a23b3c42eccd408eb/6390dc1f23b3c42eccd40ec3/1670437919898/almond-joy-bar_11b8b931-3ce9-4ee1-8786-fd20f5074a26_600x600.jpg-e1666902458333.webp?format=original" alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-1652 size-medium" /><b>Almond Joy/Mounds</b><span>Almond Joy’s got nuts, Mounds don’t. But unfortunately both have coconut, and for better or worse not enough people give either of these sleeper candy variants a fair shake. Call us nutty but we think both these candy bars don’t get their just due.</span>&nbsp;<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/62e18553aef02f736a44f06a/6390dc1a23b3c42eccd408eb/6390dc1f23b3c42eccd40eb2/1670437919658/125592-01_dots-candy-mini-packs-17-piece-bag-e1666902434370.jpg?format=original" alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-1647 size-medium" /><b>Dots</b><span>In a world of Sour Patch Kids, Mike and Ike, Starbursts and Skittles, Dots don’t get the respect they deserve. Maybe it is the throwback nature of the classic gum drop, but as is often the case with all classics, Dots are deserving of a revival.</span>&nbsp;<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/62e18553aef02f736a44f06a/6390dc1a23b3c42eccd408eb/6390dc1f23b3c42eccd40eb8/1670437919672/129629-01_warheads-smashups-extreme-sour-hard-candy-packs-12-piece-box.jpg?format=original" alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1649" /><b>Warheads</b><span>Maybe it is due in part to their “extreme” popularity in the 1990s, but these super sour candies are also in need of a comeback. But for those seeking the ultimate sour candy, nothing can compare to a Warhead.</span>&nbsp;<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/62e18553aef02f736a44f06a/6390dc1a23b3c42eccd408eb/6390dc1f23b3c42eccd40ec9/1670437919910/sugar_daddy_large_7191065b-b76a-4355-b2a8-792d20126d41.jpg.webp?format=original" alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1654" /><b>Sugar Daddy/Carmel Apple Pop</b><span>The classic lollipop is still revered, but for those that like their lollies with a bit more caramel these are for you. Both of these suckers fit in perfectly with the autumnal season.</span>&nbsp;<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/62e18553aef02f736a44f06a/6390dc1a23b3c42eccd408eb/6390dc1f23b3c42eccd40ec6/1670437919904/hsy-002436_1-e1666902409728.png?format=original" alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-1653 size-medium" /><b>Mr. Goodbar</b><span>Similar to the 100 Grand listed above, this treat is subject to its proper noun. Rename this a Mr. Bestbar and watch it skyrocket up the rankings. The undisputed king of the vaulted Hershey variety pack, sorry Hershey Milk Chocolate Bar, Hershey Dark Chocolate Bar and Krackel, but y’all are just supporting character’s to your leading man.</span>&nbsp;<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/62e18553aef02f736a44f06a/6390dc1a23b3c42eccd408eb/6390dc1f23b3c42eccd40ebb/1670437919677/007097047123-e1666902356372.jpg?format=original" alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-1650 size-medium" /><b>Hot Tamales and Fireballs</b><span>Cinnamon candy is often overlooked or viewed negatively. But these spicy candies have the perfect amount of sweet and spice. Sure your tongue might get a little numb but that's part of the fun! </span>&nbsp;<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/62e18553aef02f736a44f06a/6390dc1a23b3c42eccd408eb/6390dc1f23b3c42eccd40ecf/1670437919921/127387-01_charleston-chew-mini-size-candy-bars-120-piece-bag-e1666902382115.jpg?format=original" alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-1656 size-medium" /><b>Charleston Chew</b><span>In the world of nougat covered candies the 3 Musketeers has to be the market leader. But don’t sleep on the Charleston Chew, somewhat ironically this nougat covered treat comes in three distinct flavors (vanilla, strawberry, and chocolate) where its 3 Musketeers counterpart only comes in one.</span>&nbsp;<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/62e18553aef02f736a44f06a/6390dc1a23b3c42eccd408eb/6390dc1f23b3c42eccd40eb5/1670437919666/127355-01_reeses-pieces-candy-packs-18-piece-box-e1666902517623.jpg?format=original" alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-1648 size-medium" /><b>Reece's Pieces</b>We know, nothing can compete with the holy grail of the Halloween bucket that is the Reece's Peanut Butter Cup. But hear us out on Reece's other offering. What M&amp;Ms are to chocolate these bad boys are to peanut butter. And maybe their 1970s-inspired color scheme can compete with M&amp;Ms more technicolor tapestry. But trust us these are just as good. And if you won't take our word for it, listen to E.T. — the extra terrestrial himself knew the taste of Reece's Pieces was out of this world.</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/62e18553aef02f736a44f06a/1670438041809-NS9TVXXSUEWSOMVL3AWR/image-asset.jpeg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="844"><media:title type="plain">Underrated Halloween Candy</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Terrifying Tips: Digital Advertising Lessons Learned from Scary Movies</title><category>Blog</category><dc:creator></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Oct 2022 18:06:51 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.subsetmedia.com/blog/terrifying-tips</link><guid isPermaLink="false">62e18553aef02f736a44f06a:6390dc1a23b3c42eccd408eb:6390dc4023b3c42eccd41393</guid><description><![CDATA[<figure class="

<p data-private="redact" class="mb-2.5" data-wt-guid="1d1d863e-bd0b-495e-8bff-afdb53b9ae18">Poor decisions are a cliché of horror movies.</p>
<p>"Scream", a blockbuster film by Wes Craven, featured meta commentary on these tropes.Famously, the film outlined a set of rules for surviving horror movies. The most famous <span data-issueid="cc028ee0a0b414037a027ecdb74e4435" class="issue-underline underline text-gray-darkest font-body decoration-2 underline-offset-4 transition cursor-pointer decoration-primary-main hover:bg-primary-lightest" data-testid="issue-underline">being don’t say</span> “I’ll be right back.”
<p data-private="redact" class="mb-2.5" data-wt-guid="69a12eae-2165-4798-9c21-afde8ccfda75">Several of the cliches seen in scary movies don't necessarily apply to digital advertising, but others do.</p>
<p>For your next advertising campaign, here are some horror movie lessons:
<p data-private="redact" class="mb-2.5" data-wt-guid="ec344c06-7cd8-46aa-87fe-369fbb0434ca">Think Critically</p>
<p data-private="redact" class="mb-2.5" data-wt-guid="09d1d44f-46d9-4b23-a227-270d7c7142d4">Characters who last until the end of a movie are usually those who can accurately assess their situations. As a result of being able to recognize danger, they are better able to analyze the situation and evaluate options. A similar approach pays off in digital advertising. Assess all the information available to you before making any decisions, knowing that not everything is as it seems.</p>
<p data-private="redact" class="mb-2.5" data-wt-guid="d7786eac-effd-4071-b312-5eb2a75fca71">Don’t <span data-issueid="ade466ad3b7c556c589e3795324dbc73" class="issue-underline underline text-gray-darkest font-body decoration-2 underline-offset-4 transition cursor-pointer decoration-primary-main hover:bg-primary-lightest" data-testid="issue-underline">Go</span> it Alone</p>
<p data-private="redact" class="mb-2.5" data-wt-guid="44101202-e695-4aca-9e21-5ccb4efe3d99">One of the most critical lessons from horror films is to stick together. As a group, characters have a much better chance of overcoming the villain than as individuals. Advertising works the same way. By working together, we can share strategies, learn from each other, and combine ideas and strategies to make a much more effective action plan. The same rule applies to campaign phases and channel mix, which perform better when combined rather than isolated.</p>
<p data-private="redact" class="mb-2.5" data-wt-guid="3ec1b314-2b3b-47de-aabf-de4295cca5e5">No shortcuts</p>
<p data-private="redact" class="mb-2.5" data-wt-guid="a3dcb099-88cb-4025-8d4d-b01a93689f8b">It's never a <span data-issueid="329a68a46c8c0beea2f23e204b00a451" class="issue-underline underline text-gray-darkest font-body decoration-2 underline-offset-4 transition cursor-pointer decoration-primary-main hover:bg-primary-lightest" data-testid="issue-underline">sound</span> idea to take shortcuts when escaping the killer. The character often thinks they are outsmarting the antagonist but is usually foiled at every turn. The same rule applies to campaigns. Shortcuts don't always lead to where you expected. You will often end up backtracking or <span data-issueid="9059d08218247b5879351e8095616c33" class="issue-underline underline text-gray-darkest font-body decoration-2 underline-offset-4 transition cursor-pointer decoration-primary-main hover:bg-primary-lightest" data-testid="issue-underline">worse</span> if you take shortcuts.</p>
<p data-private="redact" class="mb-2.5" data-wt-guid="a0a71154-3d76-45cc-86f8-b72800a70dd5">Equip Yourself</p>
<p data-private="redact" class="mb-2.5" data-wt-guid="9524718c-33f3-488f-ab84-6dac924ef84c">Horror movies require you to even the odds against the villain. It is often the protagonist who gets the upper hand by making use of the resources available to them, whether it is a weapon or a trap. Digital marketers often set up ambitious campaigns without using all the tools available to them. Nothing is more terrifying than seeing a well-planned campaign with excellent creative go live without taking full advantage of its resources</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/png" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/62e18553aef02f736a44f06a/1670438041308-BW7G5I1Z6V9RR4FE2PER/image-asset.png?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="844"><media:title type="plain">Terrifying Tips: Digital Advertising Lessons Learned from Scary Movies</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>TrendSet: Mobile share of ad spend continues to spike</title><category>TrendSet</category><dc:creator></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 18 Oct 2022 12:57:36 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.subsetmedia.com/blog/mobile-spike</link><guid isPermaLink="false">62e18553aef02f736a44f06a:6390dc1a23b3c42eccd408eb:6390dc4023b3c42eccd41375</guid><description><![CDATA[<figure class="

<p>U.S. ad sales are expected to top $300 million this year thanks to connected TV and digital out-of-home.In the second half of the year, media intelligence company Manga predicts record-breaking spends driven both by emerging channels and hefty political ad budgets.Despite inflation, economic uncertainty, and rising costs, this anticipated spending record may shock some in the advertising industry.Some formats, like social media ads, have slowed down in 2022. However, ad spend has soared on other channels, led by OTT with a 30 percent growth and CTV with a 18 percent growth.</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/62e18553aef02f736a44f06a/1670438040524-IQW7SG2C3PXFJOJXYNWS/image-asset.jpeg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="844"><media:title type="plain">U.S. ad sales set to surpass spending record in 2022</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Must Watch Space Movies</title><category>Blog</category><dc:creator></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 07 Oct 2022 17:52:36 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.subsetmedia.com/blog/must-watch-space-movies</link><guid isPermaLink="false">62e18553aef02f736a44f06a:6390dc1a23b3c42eccd408eb:6390dc4023b3c42eccd41359</guid><description><![CDATA[<figure class="

<p><span>This week is World Space Week, and what better way to honor a holiday that few have ever heard of, than to sit on your couch and watch movies. Here is Subset's list of space movies we think you just have to watch... and a few bonus space facts thrown in along the way.</span>&nbsp;<span><img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/62e18553aef02f736a44f06a/6390dc1a23b3c42eccd408eb/6390dc4623b3c42eccd414b6/1670437958185/MV5BNzc5MjkzZWEtMjBmZS00NDJlLWI3N2UtNzgwYmI4ZGM5ODM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTMwNjQ3Nzg%40._V1_-203x300.jpg?format=original" alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-1616 alignleft" /> Chuck’s Pick</span><span>Prospect - 2018</span><span>There are so many great choices of movies that take place in space or distant planets, and many of them span across all genres, not just sci-fi. Action, historical, drama, fantasy, etc. My “must watch” falls strangely in the sci-fi western category. No, not “Cowboys vs. Aliens”. Prospect (2018)  combines elements of deep space travel with gunslingers, lawless wilderness and the hopes of striking it rich. A girl and her father fight natural elements, outlaws and the blurred lines of good and bad for survival.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Fact: Space Does Not “technically” have a temperature. In order to have temperature one must have particles with mass. The speed of movement of particles generates heat. Particles that move fast are hot, and particles moving slow are cold. In a perfect vacuum there is a total absence of particles, therefore, no temperature. Space however is not completely void. We are able to measure wavelengths between particles left over from the big bang to determine what temperature a human might “feel” in space. This felt temperature varies depending on the location in space, but averages about 2.7 kelvin (-455ºF). Just a smidge above absolute zero.</span>&nbsp;<span><img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/62e18553aef02f736a44f06a/6390dc1a23b3c42eccd408eb/6390dc1f23b3c42eccd40e91/1670437919595/MV5BMTc2MTQ3MDA1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODA3OTI4NjE%40._V1_.jpg?format=original" alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-1613 alignleft" />Claire’s Pick</span><span>The Martian (2015) </span><span>The ultimate survival tale of a man who is mistakenly left behind on Mars when his crew thinks he's dead. Using limited resources must cope with the realization help may never come and he has to choose between holding on to hope or facing death. </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Fact: Astronauts often return to earth a few inches taller than when they left. This is due to the lack of gravity allowing their spines to stretch out. It’s like the ultimate chiropractor! </span><span>Fact: There is a website where you can check how many people are in space on any given day. (There are 10 as of Oct. 6th 2022 and all have been there for 300+ days) </span><a href="https://www.howmanypeopleareinspacerightnow.com/"><span>https://www.howmanypeopleareinspacerightnow.com/</span></a> <span></span><span></span><span><img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/62e18553aef02f736a44f06a/6390dc1a23b3c42eccd408eb/6390dc1f23b3c42eccd40e9d/1670437919620/MV5BOGQzZTBjMjQtOTVmMS00NGE5LWEyYmMtOGQ1ZGZjNmRkYjFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc%40._V1_.jpg?format=original" alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-1617 alignleft" />Jake’s Pick</span><span>Alien (1979) </span><span>Space is scary, even scarier when you realize in space, nobody can hear you scream. And Ridley’s Scott take on the traditional movie monster certainly is enhanced by its setting. Revered by both fans of the horror and sci-fi genres, the film sets up the ultimate movie villain the titular Alien, aka the xenomorph, vs iconic hero Ripley.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Fact: Space doesn't have air or atmosphere. It's a vacuum, so sound waves can't travel. </span><span> (See above, re: the screaming)</span><span>Fact: </span><span>The number of stars in the universe is incalculable.  There are so many stars in space that it's impossible to count them all. Scientists and astronomers use the number of stars in our galaxy, the Milky Way, to estimate. That estimation is somewhere between 200-400 billion, which would then need to be multiplied by the billions of estimated galaxies, hence a very large and unknown number.</span>&nbsp;<span><img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/62e18553aef02f736a44f06a/6390dc1a23b3c42eccd408eb/6390dc1f23b3c42eccd40e94/1670437919601/MV5BMTk4NzAwOTkwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDM3MTM3._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg?format=original" alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-1614 alignleft" />Ben’s Pick</span><span>Space Cowboys (2000)</span><span>I can hear Justin Timberlake in my head already; “Why-yi-yi-yippie-yi-yay-yippie-yi-yo-yippie-yi-yay”. </span><span>When a Russian military satellite goes on the fritz, there is only one team of old timers with enough grit to get the job done. Clint Eastwood. Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland and James Garner team up to save the planet in the only way this group of grumpy old men know how. Not saying it’s the best space movie ever made, but it’s certainly one everybody should see at least once.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span><img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/62e18553aef02f736a44f06a/6390dc1a23b3c42eccd408eb/6390dc1f23b3c42eccd40e97/1670437919607/MV5BNWExNzg3MmMtYjc3MS00MzFlLWJiOWQtNWYxZTgxNjhlZTQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzkwMjQ5NzM%40._V1_.jpg?format=original" alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-1615 alignleft" />Joel’s Pick</span><span>Starship Troopers (1997)</span><span>“The only good bug, is a dead bug”. What can we say about this little flick. Is it so bad that it’s good, or is it just good, good? A pseudo-satire on military and fascism, this film has action, romance, campy military propaganda, and (surprise) Neil Patrick Harris performing giant bug telepathy. Star studded with all the best and worst faces of the late 90’s action genre, including Mr Krabs as Sgt. Zim, this is arguably the ugliest masterpiece of American cinema.</span><br /><br /></p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/62e18553aef02f736a44f06a/1670438040928-97RIGUBZSM2L10I60WBA/image-asset.jpeg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="844"><media:title type="plain">Must Watch Space Movies</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>94 percent of U.S. households reachable through CTV, study finds</title><category>Blog</category><dc:creator></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 03 Oct 2022 21:16:01 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.subsetmedia.com/blog/ctv-study</link><guid isPermaLink="false">62e18553aef02f736a44f06a:6390dc1a23b3c42eccd408eb:6390dc3f23b3c42eccd41351</guid><description><![CDATA[<figure class="

<p>There is no doubt that connected television continues to grow in popularity, with programmatic connected TV ads now being able to reach nearly every American household.In the first half of 2022, CTV was able be to reach 94 percent of U.S. households, according to Pixalate. This is a 10 percent increase from the same time a year ago.According to the report, CTV spend has increased 4X since 2019. A lot of this is due to the widespread adoption of connected TV devices, smart televisions, and CTV apps.On the device side, Roku leads the way with 44 percent of ad spend, followed by Samsung with 17 percent, Amazon with 12 percent and Apple with 9 percent. On the content side, movie and television dominate ad placements and this looks to only increase as Disney Plus and Netflix are both entering the ad-supported market in Q4.</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/62e18553aef02f736a44f06a/1670438037709-G0H4N64TS7LYXPPAWZHB/image-asset.jpeg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="844"><media:title type="plain">94 percent of U.S. households reachable through CTV, study finds</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Favorite Fall Activities</title><category>Uncategorized</category><dc:creator></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 01 Oct 2022 15:51:49 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.subsetmedia.com/blog/fall-activities</link><guid isPermaLink="false">62e18553aef02f736a44f06a:6390dc1a23b3c42eccd408eb:6390dc3f23b3c42eccd4134e</guid><description><![CDATA[<figure class="

<p><span>Fall is here, and its time to thrown on a wool scarf and grab your favorite hot drink to hit the outdoors. Here are a few of our favorite autumnal activities.</span>&nbsp;<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/62e18553aef02f736a44f06a/6390dc1a23b3c42eccd408eb/6390dc4523b3c42eccd414a1/1670437957989/AdobeStock_376422895-300x200.jpeg?format=original" alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-1602" /><span>Carving pumpkins and roasting the seeds! Pro tip: try a spicy seasoning blend. A truly underrated snack that you’ll look forward to all year. </span>&nbsp;<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/62e18553aef02f736a44f06a/6390dc1a23b3c42eccd408eb/6390dc4623b3c42eccd414a4/1670437958010/AdobeStock_71683297-300x209.jpeg?format=original" alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-1594" /><span>Harvest festivals. When the weather finally cools off a bit, grabbing a hot cider and spending a day outside with family and friends is the perfect way to spend a weekend in the fall. </span>&nbsp;<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/62e18553aef02f736a44f06a/6390dc1a23b3c42eccd408eb/6390dc4623b3c42eccd414a7/1670437958034/AdobeStock_286291424-300x200.jpeg?format=original" alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-1601" /><span>Corn maze. Nothing says fall like wandering through a corn maze. A slightly different take on supporting your local farmer, but an unforgettable experience that is an all-time fall classic.</span>&nbsp;<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/62e18553aef02f736a44f06a/6390dc1a23b3c42eccd408eb/6390dc4623b3c42eccd414aa/1670437958087/AdobeStock_380700712-300x200.jpeg?format=original" alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1603" /><span>Go apple picking, The aforementioned hot cider is certainly a fall staple. Take it up a notch and visit a local orchard. You can double up the fall festivities by turning the apples into pie, strudel or candied or carmel apples. </span>&nbsp;<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/62e18553aef02f736a44f06a/6390dc1a23b3c42eccd408eb/6390dc4623b3c42eccd414ad/1670437958110/AdobeStock_88110549-300x200.jpeg?format=original" alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-1595" /><span>Go to a local football game. Be it high school, college or the pros. Nothing says fall like football. Even if you aren’t a diehard fan it is easy to revel in the gameday experience, which almost certainly will include some tailgating and marching bands.</span>&nbsp;<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/62e18553aef02f736a44f06a/6390dc1a23b3c42eccd408eb/6390dc4623b3c42eccd414b0/1670437958133/AdobeStock_175366187-300x200.jpeg?format=original" alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-1597" /><span>Try a seasonal coffee. There is a reason pumpkin spice is everywhere this time of year. If you haven’t tried it, give it a go.

<p>Google may have yet again kicked the can down the road as far as depreciating third-party cookies in its Chrome browser.Other browsers, however, haven’t procrastinated in going cookie-less.Both Apple’s Safari and Mozilla’s Firefox browsers have dropped third party cookies.While publishers have lamented on the CPM delta between identical inventory placements on cookieless and cookie-enabled browsers, advertisers are able to reap the rewards as the industry sits halfway between a cookieless future and one still very much dependent upon them.The CPM delta between cookie enabled browsers and cookieless browsers can be as much as 50 percent. This makes the ads served on Safari and Firefox often a certified bargain in comparison the same placements on Chrome.But the rub is activating these high-value placements without relying on cookies. This can be achieved by leaning into tactics such as contextual targeting, geolocation and ensuring maximum viewability.These targeting tactics have been considered second-rate compared to cookie-based targeting because of the over-reliance on cookies in the past. As a result, there is the aforementioned discount on cookieless inventory at the moment.Now is the time for marketers to develop a sound strategy to unlock these placements and rely less on cookies and more on site content and user location.By doing this, advertisers can not only prepare for the cookieless future, but also increase efficiency both in terms of performance and cost in the present.</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/62e18553aef02f736a44f06a/1670438037310-J6YYMELKFLUDA35EQKEH/image-asset.jpeg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="844"><media:title type="plain">Despite Google’s procrastination: Advertisers can start their cookie diet today</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Localized messaging is effective and privacy-friendly</title><category>Blog</category><dc:creator></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 20 Sep 2022 17:01:54 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.subsetmedia.com/blog/localized-messaging-is-effective-and-privacy-friendly</link><guid isPermaLink="false">62e18553aef02f736a44f06a:6390dc1a23b3c42eccd408eb:6390dc3f23b3c42eccd41346</guid><description><![CDATA[<figure class="

<p>With cookies set to expire sooner rather than later, marketers cannot rely exclusively on them, and must expand their programmatic playbooks to incorporate additional targeting techniques.Among the most effective strategies are: contextual and geo-based targeting. They are not only tried-and-true, but often more cost-effective than user ID-based targeting. We've already looked at contextual targeting, so here are some ways that advertisers can reach their audiences by using geo-based targeting strategies like location targeting, localized marketing, and geotargeting.
Marketers might overlook the power of location targeting, but it's hard to overstate. Adverts can personalize brand messages by targeting by country, city, or zip code based on information like language, food, weather, sports teams, music, history, landmarks, and more. Custom creative can be built for specific audiences with this type of targeting (sometimes called "localized marketing"). By using local information, advertisers can personalize their messages without feeling intrusive.Think about it, this is a cornerstone of fundamental advertising. The local car dealership, the mattress company, or bank with the local or regional spokesperson, this type of messaging resonates because it is localized. Your brand represents them, and where they live. When harnessed correctly this is very powerful in helping to drive engagement and action within a targeted market.For that reason, ads with localized creative might be some of the most delightful and unobtrusive advertisements consumers can see. Just enough targeted to feel tailored, but not too targeted that it's creepy. It's crucial to get that balance right in modern marketing.So much like contextual targeting, geo-location based targeting with messaging tailored to the market can be a fundamental way to garner advertising results without having to tap into cookie-based audiences. By refreshing up on this often overlooked, yet powerful, strategy campaings can better lock efficiencies and be set up for future success.]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/62e18553aef02f736a44f06a/1670438037207-FU2NPNH56R5JLRPCDWUC/image-asset.jpeg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="844"><media:title type="plain">Localized messaging is effective and privacy-friendly</media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
